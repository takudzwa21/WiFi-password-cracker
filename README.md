WiFi-Password-Cracker 🔥
📌 Overview
WiFi-AutoConnect-Cracker is a Python-based tool that scans for available WiFi networks, automatically connects to open networks, and attempts to crack secured networks using a wordlist-based dictionary attack. The script leverages the pywifi library for network interactions and colorama for enhanced terminal output.

🚀 Features
✅ Automatic Network Scanning – Lists all nearby WiFi networks.
✅ Auto Connect to Open Networks – Instantly connects to open networks without passwords.
✅ Dictionary Attack for Secured Networks – Tries passwords from a wordlist to crack protected WiFi.
✅ User-Friendly Console Output – Color-coded messages for better readability.
✅ Simple and Lightweight – No unnecessary dependencies, just pure Python automation.
✅I posted 2 codes, one without GUI and the other one with GUI which is user friendly made with python tkinter
